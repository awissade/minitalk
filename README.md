The "Minitalk" project 📡🚀 is an exciting venture into creating a client-server communication system 🖥️💬📱 using UNIX signals in C. This task involves developing two executables, 'client' and 'server', where the server announces its PID 🆔✨ upon initialization, and the client sends messages 📤✉️ using SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 signals. Emphasizing signal handling, process communication, error management, and memory efficiency, the project is a deep dive into low-level programming. Bonus challenges 🌟🔍 include message receipt acknowledgments and Unicode support, enhancing your technical repertoire for future coding endeavors.
